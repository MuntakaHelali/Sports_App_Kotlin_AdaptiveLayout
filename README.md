Sports App
===================================

Sports app is a basic sports news application that make use of adaptive layouts. When the user launches the application on a smarphone(non-foldable/foldable), they are presented with a screen containing a list of Sports. When the user selects one of those sports to read more news about it, they are redirected to another screen showing the details about the news for that respective sport. The user can select the back button on their android device to go back to the list screen.

Assuming the device is a tablet instead, the application launched will make use of an Adaptive Layout due to the use of SinglePaneLayout component in the AndroidX Library. The application will instead display the list of items in the left content pane, and the detail screen on the right content pane of the device. When the user selects on a sport, the left and right content pane will automatically update.
